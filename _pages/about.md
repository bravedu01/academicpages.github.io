Welcome to the Du Lab at XXX University.
We study type I interferonâ€“related diseases, including rheumatic autoimmune disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases.
Our research leverages cutting-edge technologiesâ€”single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and CRISPR screeningâ€”to investigate the regulation of type I interferon responses in both physiological and pathological contexts, using human biopsy samples and genetically engineered mouse models.
