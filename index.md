Welcome to the Du Lab 杜勇实验室 at XXX University.  
We study type I interferon–related diseases, including rheumatic autoimmune disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases.  
Our research uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and CRISPR screening to uncover the regulation of type I interferon responses in both human biopsies and mouse models.
